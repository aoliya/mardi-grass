                    <p>
                        "Mardi Gras Indians are secretive because only certain people participated in
                        masking--people with questionable character. In the old day, the Indians were violent. Indians
                        would meet on
                        Mardi Gras; it was a day to settle scores." - <strong>Bannock, Past
                            President, New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Mardi Gras Indians are comprised, in large part, of the African-American communities of
                        New Orleans's inner city. While these Indians have paraded for well over a century, their parade
                        is perhaps the least recognized Mardi Gras tradition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Mardi Gras Indians--the parade most white people don't see. The ceremonial procession is loose,
                        the parade is not scheduled for a particular time or route...that is up to the Big Chief." -

                                Traditional Mardi Gras organizations form a "krewe." A krewe often names their parade
                                after a particular Roman or Greek mythological hero or god. The ranking structure of a
                                Mardi Gras Krewe is a parody of royalty: King, Queen, Dukes, Knights and Captains, or
                                some
                                variation of that theme. Many of the more established krewes allow membership by
                                invitation only.

                                Few in the ghetto felt they could ever participate in the typical New Orleans parade.
                                Historically, slavery and racism were at the root of this cultural separation. The black
                                neighborhoods in New Orleans gradually developed their own style of celebrating
                                Mardi Gras. Their krewes are named for imaginary Indian tribes according to the streets
                                of their ward or gang.

                        The Mardi Gras Indians named themselves after native Indians to pay them respect for their
                        assistance in escaping the tyranny of slavery. It was often local Indians who accepted slaves
                        into their society when they made a break for freedom. They have never forgotten this
                        support.<span id="dots">...</span>

                            Long ago, Mardi Gras was a violent day for many Mardi Gras Indians. It was a day often used
                            to settle scores. The police were often unable to intervene due to the general confusion
                            surrounding Mardi Gras events in the city, when the streets were crowded and everyone was
                            masked. This kept many families away from the "parade," and created much worry and concern
                            for a mothers whose children wanted to join the Indians.

                                    Today when two Mardi Gras Indian tribes pass one another, you will see a living
                                    theater of art and culture. Each tribe's style and dress is on display in a friendly
                                    but competitive manner. They compare one another's art and craftsmanship.

                                    The Big Chiefs of two different tribes start with a song/chant, ceremonial dance,
                                    and threatening challenge to "Humba". The Big Chief's demand that the other Chief
                                    bows and pays respect. The retort is a whoop and equally impressive song and war
                                    dance
                                    with the reply, "Me no Humba, YOU Humba!"

                            Although there was a history of violence, many now choose to keep this celebration friendly.
                            Each Big Chief will eventually stand back and, with a theatrical display of
                            self-confidence, acknowledge the artistry and craftsmanship of the other chief's suit.

                            Before the progression can continue, the two Big Chiefs will often comment privately to one
                            another, "Looking good, baby, looking good!"

                            The good news is Mardi Gras day is no longer a day to "settle scores" among the Mardi Gras
                            Indians. Now that the tradition and practice for the Indians to compare their tribal song,
                            dance and dress with other tribes as they meet that day, violence is a thing of the past.
                            The Mardi Gras Indian has invested thousands of hours and dollars in the creation of his
                            suit, and will not run the risk of ruining it in a fight. This tradition, rich with folk art
                            and history, is
                            now appreciated by museums and historical societies around the world. It is a remarkable and
                            welcome change from the past.

                    <p>
                        So what are "throws?" Well, they are exactly what they sound like - items that krewe members on
                        floats throw to parade-goers as the floats pass by! Throws often include doubloons, beads, cups,
                        homemade trinkets, toys and more!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The throwing of trinkets to the crowds was started in the early 1870s by the Twelfth Night
                        Revelers, and is a time-honored expectation for young and old alike.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1884, Rex started using medallions instead of trinkets. These medallions are represented by
                        today's doubloons, aluminum and anodized in many different colors. They depict the parade theme
                        on one side and the Krewe's emblem on the other. They have become collectors items.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the Bacchus parade, the King's float throws doubloons with the image of the celebrity king on
                        one side of the doubloon. If you're lucky enough to catch one, hold onto it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most prized throws are the krewe's "signature throws." Zulu has it famous coconuts and many
                        other krewes offer hand-decorated items including Muses shoes, Nyx purses, Alla genie lamps,
                        Carrollton shrimp boots and the list goes on. Most krewes have medallion beads that feature that
                        year's theme.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Other popular throws include cups (otherwise known as New Orleans dinnerware), long pearl beads
                        and stuffed animals. Some throws even light up.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Be warned! If you're at your first parade and reach down to pick up a doubloon with your hand,
                        your fingers may never be the same! Many stomp on doubloons in their rush to claim them
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hint: If you're standing next to a bunch of old grandmothers dressed in high heels and playboy
                        bunny outfits, don't think your chances are any better. They may be old, but they have fast feet
                        and the spikes on those heels - ouch!
