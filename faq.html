                      No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs
                      to everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses who offer
                      "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website.
                      Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their
                      products or services to those who do not know better. Products or
                      websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each
                      individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In
                      some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi
                      Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                        The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast
                        of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a
                        different day each year.

                        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the
                        same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is always the day before Ash
                        Wednesday.

                        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi
                        Gras day and stay through Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see
                        when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years

                        The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm,
                        almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the other
                        during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a
                        chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and
                        clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast
                        for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring
                        a raincoat!

                        The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans
                        for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of
                        the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans.
                        The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers.
                        If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat
                        Tuesday are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another
                        big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival
                        goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and
                        seeing all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling

                        By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family
                        celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our
                        children have grown up and we continue going to every parade, because we
                        used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even
                        large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws
                        often include toys, stuffed animals, beads and more.

                        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where
                        no full-size parades pass anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when
                        they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon, since parades can last
                        until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of
                        St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking
                        out their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and
                        having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about
                        the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in the
                        suburban areas like Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New
                        Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras
                        weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love
                        it!

                        (generally the Sunday closest to St. Joseph’s Day in March).

                        The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in
                        and around their inner city neighborhoods. Some sources say that you
                        will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner of LaSalle and 2nd
                        Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu
                        passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans
                        following the Zulu parade.

                        The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday
                        on the third Sunday of March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities
                        begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington & LaSalle Streets)
                        where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their feathers and
                        suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."

                        For the Indian Sunday parade route, visit our Super Sunday page.

                        Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold thier
                        "Super Sunday" parade on the Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with
                        the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years, there has been
                        yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that falls in April during
                        the open weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No
                        specific details are available on these events at this time.

                        There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no single
                        organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe decides on its
                        own theme each year, which is often kept secret until the parade. Their
                        costumes, floats, some of their throws, and their "official" Mardi Gras
                        poster (if they have one) reflect this theme. For example, after 9/11,
                        patriotic themes were popular.

                        Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and
                        Egyptian mythology, but some are named after the neighborhood where they
